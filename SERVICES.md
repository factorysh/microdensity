# Service

µdensity exposes services.

## REST trigger

A service exposes a REST endpoint, authenticated with Gitlab's JWT token, throught the CI.

The JSON POST body is validated by a *validate* function, wroten in the `meta.js` file.
The validation use [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja), a sync javascript interpreter.
The validation is synchronous, and return an id, or an error.

## Service in a container

The service itself is asynchronous, using a queue, and the run has constant and dedicated resources.

The service is described by a `docker-compose.yml` file, using the *Compose 2* version.

µdensity exposes private services, like [browserless](https://www.browserless.io/), usable from your services.

Services must mount volume for exposing results.

## Badges

You services can write `*.badge` file, a json file with **color/subject/status** keys.
The url use the Gitlab's badge format, and rendered with [go-badge](https://github.com/narqo/go-badge). The badge are almost public, with a tiny protection (Gitlab badge are fully public).

## Reports

Your services can write HTML report, they will be exposed behind an OAuth2 authentication.
