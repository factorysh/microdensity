# Service

µdensity provides badges for your projects. Analysis are triggered by your CI (asynchronously), and linked to a branch and a git commit.

µdensity exposes services.

A service is a folder:

```
services/demo
           |
           +- docker-compose.yml
           +- README.md
           +- meta.js
           +- meta.yml
```

## Self documenting

A service exposes a README.md, explaining what it does, how to use it.

A minimalistic CSS is provided, your documentation will be not so ugly.

## REST trigger

A service exposes a REST endpoint, authenticated with Gitlab's JWT token, throught the CI.

The JSON POST body is validated by a *validate* function, wroten in the `meta.js` file.
The validation use [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja), a sync javascript interpreter.
The validation is synchronous, and return an id, or an error.

## Service in a container

The service itself is asynchronous, using a queue, and the run has constant and dedicated resources.

The service is described by a `docker-compose.yml` file, using the *Compose 2* format. With *Compose 1*, format was versionned (2.x or 3.x), now, the format is specified.

µdensity exposes private services, like [browserless](https://www.browserless.io/), usable from your services.

Services must mount volume for exposing results.

## Badges

You services can write `*.badge` file, a json file with **color/subject/status** keys.
The url use the Gitlab's badge format, and rendered with [go-badge](https://github.com/narqo/go-badge). The badge are almost public, with a tiny protection (Gitlab badge are fully public).

## Reports

Your services can write HTML report, they will be exposed behind an OAuth2 authentication.
